I'm an assiduous reader of Medium and always loved its simple and content focused design. That's why I decided to start this blog, using GitHub pages and a local installation of Ghost.</p><h2 id="how-to-setup-a-github-pages-website-using-ghost-as-content-editing-platform">How to setup a GitHub pages website using Ghost as content editing platform?</h2><p>From all the alternatives to do it, i decided to have a local instance of Ghost and publishing of the static files to GitHub using Buster. Even when Buster seemed quite outdated to the time I made this installation, I found this excellent step by step tutorial which I changed just a bit to use Ghost-CLI.</p><h3 id="1-install-node-js-on-your-machine">1. Install Node.js on your machine</h3><p>If you haven't installed yet you can do it many ways, from installing the package from the official website to using HomeBrew on your Mac. As I'm a MacOS user, I handle all my packages with brew.</p><p><code>brew install node</code></p>
<p>If you don't have brew installed, you can follow this quick tutorial.</p><h3 id="2-be-sure-you-have-installed-the-node-version-required-by-ghost-cli">2. Be sure you have installed the Node version required by Ghost-CLI</h3><p>I liked the idea of using Ghost-CLI. However, it only runs on the LTS version of node (currently 8.6). In order to handle multiple versions of node on your machine you can use a package named n. You can use npm to install it</p><p><code>$ npm install n -g</code></p>
<p>Then you can install the required node version by running:</p>
<p><code>$ n 8.6</code></p>
<h3 id="3-install-the-ghost-cli-using-npm">3. Install the Ghost-CLI using npm</h3><p>Then you can install the ghost-cli using npm by running:</p><p><code>$ npm install ghost-cli -g</code></p>
<h3 id="4-select-a-folder-for-your-ghost-installation-and-run-the-cli-installation-script">4. Select a folder for your Ghost installation and run the CLI installation script</h3><p>In order to version the code of my ghost installation, I created a GitHub repo. After cloning on my machine I entered the folder I wanted ghost to be installed and did an:</p><p><code>$ ghost install local</code></p>
<p>You should see something like this:</p><figure class="kg-image-card"><img src="https://juansaab.github.io/content/images/2018/08/Install-ghost-locally-with-ghost-cli.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to create your own Medium like blog on GitHub Pages using Ghost for free"></figure><h3 id="5-create-your-account-and-enter-the-administration-panel-to-setup-your-blog">5. Create your account and enter the administration panel to setup your blog</h3><p>Once the installation is finished, you can open <a href="https://juansaab.github.io/ghost/">https://juansaab.github.io/ghost/</a> on your navigator to open the administration panel for your new blog. After creating your account you will have a nice blog with some introductory posts about how to use Ghost. If you want to delete them, you can just delete the author named Ghost from the <em>Team</em> panel.</p><h3 id="6-setup-buster-to-publish-your-website">6. Setup buster to publish your website</h3><p>In order to generate the static files from your Ghost installation and publish it to Github you can use a Python package called <em>buster</em>. If you run buster without having Python 3 installed you'll probably find an exception. So if after running python --version you get <em>"Python 2.7.15" </em>you can install Python 3 by running<em> brew install python.</em></p><p>Then if you're sure you have Python 3 on your machine, you can install buster using pip.</p><p><code>$ pip install git+https://github.com/manthansharma/buster/</code></p>
<p>In order to use buster you will need wget also, so in case you don't have it installed you can installing it using Homebrew.</p><p><code>$ brew install wget</code></p>
<h3 id="7-clone-your-github-pages-repository-into-the-static-folder">7. Clone your Github pages repository into the /static folder</h3><p>The content for your block will be exported as static files into the /static folder. Create the folder /static inside your Ghost installation and then clone your repository into that folder. Remember to create your Github pages repository first naming it as <em>your-username.github.io</em></p><p><code>$ git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git static</code></p>
<h3 id="8-generate-your-static-files-using-buster-and-push-to-github">8. Generate your static files using buster and push to GitHub</h3><p>Finally, after making changes on your blog you'll be ready to push it and publish to GitHub. Buster has two steps: generation and deploy.</p><p>To make the generation you have to run the following command:</p><p><code>$ buster generate --domain=https://juansaab.github.io --web-url=https://username.github.io</code></p>
<p>Then you can deploy it to GitHub with the following command:</p><p><code>$ buster deploy</code></p>
<p>If everything went well, you should be able to visit your blog at https://username.github.io</p><h2 id="how-to-keep-updating-your-blog">How to keep updating your blog?</h2><p>When you need to write new post or make changes at your blog, you will have to load the Ghost environment locally and repeat the generation and deploy steps.</p><p>At the Ghost directory run the following command to start the Ghost server.</p>
<p><code>$ npm start</code></p>
<p>Then, after making changes, you can generate and deploy by running</p>
<p><code>$ buster generate --domain=https://juansaab.github.io --web-url=https://username.github.io</code></p>
<p>And then</p>
<p><code>$ buster deploy</code></p>
